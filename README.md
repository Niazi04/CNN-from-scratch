## Future Improvements

- [ ] Decouple Loss Functions and Optimizers into their own classes
- [ ] Fix pool size problem
- [ ] Clean up random variable naming conventions
- [ ] Add different related optimizers
- [ ] Add different related Loss Functions
- [ ] Implement batch normalizer (similar to DataLoader in Pytorch)
